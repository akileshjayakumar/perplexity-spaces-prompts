# Perplexity Spaces – Prompt Collections

This repository contains modular, high-quality system prompts designed for use within **Perplexity Spaces**. Each folder represents an individual space or assistant, tailored to specific prompt workflows or use cases.

### Structure

- Each subfolder (e.g., `PromptTacular/`) contains:
  - A `system_prompt.md` file defining the assistant’s behaviour, rules, and formatting.
  - A `README.md` file documenting usage, features, and example prompts.
  - Optionally, links to resources or documentation used by the assistant.

### Goals

- **Rapid prototyping** of prompt-based assistants
- **Reusable configurations** for different prompt types (e.g., rewriting, generating, templating)
- **Separation of concerns** between prompt logic, UX documentation, and prompt source material

### Spaces Currently Included

- `PromptTacular/`  
  A precision-focused assistant for rewriting, generating, and templating prompts for users and LLM app developers.
